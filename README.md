# Java
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. Developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and now maintained by Oracle, Java is widely used for building web applications, desktop software, Android apps, enterprise systems, and more.
One of Javaâ€™s key features is its platform independence code written in Java is compiled into bytecode, which can run on any device equipped with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
# Data Types In Java
In Java, data types define the kind of data a variable can hold. Java is a statically-typed language, meaning you must declare the data type of a variable before using it.
Java data types are broadly classified into two categories:
# 1. Basic Data Types
byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean
# 2. User Defined 
array, class, function
